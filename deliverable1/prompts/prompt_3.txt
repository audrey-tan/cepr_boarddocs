You are given a CSV with two columns: title_1 and index.

Your task is to classify the rows into "school_district" or "drop". Your answer will be a new column called "classification".

You will output a CSV that has only two columns: "classification" and "index".

Rows that will be classified as "school_district" are any agencies or school boards. They can also be universities or cities. For example, these rows can be classified as "school_district"
