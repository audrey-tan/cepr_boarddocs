This csv has three columns: title_1, address, and school_district. Many values are empty.

Your goal is to add a fourth column "action" that classifies the value at title_1 as "address", "school_district", "None" or "drop". DO NOT USE ANY PROGRAMMING. Do not use Python. You should manually classify the rows

Do not overwrite any values. For example, if there is an item in "school_district", do not classify that title_1 as school_district.

Here are some examples:

For example, for the row

Christopher Newport University,"1 Avenue of the Arts Newport News, VA 23606 | (757) 594-7000",

You should put Christopher Newport University as the school_district, which is third column, that is

,"1 Avenue of the Arts Newport News, VA 23606 | (757) 594-7000","Christopher Newport University"

Another example

Quality to the Core,,Central Dauphin School District

You should just drop the title_1, since it is a slogan

,,Central Dauphin School District

Another example

75 Chenango Ave Clinton NY13323,,Clinton Central School District

You should put this in the address column

,75 Chenango Ave Clinton NY13323,Clinton Central School District

DO NOT USE ANY PROGRAMMING.

You should classify it manually. You do not need to give your reasoning. Just output the csv.

To check that you understand, output the first 500 rows. To make things easier for you, only output the new column called "action"
