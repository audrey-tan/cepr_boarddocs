This csv has four columns: title_1, address, school_district, and index. Many values are empty.

Your goal is to add a fifth column "action" that classifies the value at title_1 as "address", "school_district", "None" or "drop". DO NOT USE ANY PROGRAMMING. Do not use Python. You should manually classify the rows.

To emphasize, your goal is to classify the value at title_1.

Do not overwrite any values. For example, if there is an item in "school_district", do not classify that title_1 as school_district.

To make things easier for you, only output the index column and the new column called "action".

Here are some examples:

For example, for the row

32, Christopher Newport University,"1 Avenue of the Arts Newport News, VA 23606 | (757) 594-7000",

You should put Christopher Newport University as a school_district, so the action is "school_district"

Another example

21, Quality to the Core,,Central Dauphin School District

You should just drop the title_1, since it is a slogan, so the action is "drop"

Another example

155, 75 Chenango Ave Clinton NY13323,,Clinton Central School District

You should put this in the address column, so the action is "address"

Putting it all together, if the input is

index,title_1,address,school_district
32, Christopher Newport University,"1 Avenue of the Arts Newport News, VA 23606 | (757) 594-7000",
21, Quality to the Core,,Central Dauphin School District
155, 75 Chenango Ave Clinton NY13323,,Clinton Central School District

Then your output is 

index,action
32, school_district
21, drop
155, address

You should only set action to None if the corresponding title_1 is None.

You can classify the schools as school_districts. For example, Caroline County Public Schools can be classified as a "school_district".

Make sure you don't overwrite any existing values in address or school_district.

Do not put "address" as your "action" if there is already a value in the address column for that row. Similarly for school_district.

Only output None for None fields.

You should classify it manually. You do not need to give your reasoning. Just output the csv.

You should only output the index column and your new action column. Classify this whole dataset.
